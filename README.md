## Final Project - Description


## Options

### Option 1 - Tech Demo 2D or 3D

Often a game mechanic or graphical technique is later developed into a game. For your final project you can build a high powered tech demo. This should be a short showcase of some feature demo that showcases your technology. 

Some examples of tech demos

### Option 2 - Game Maker

For your final project, you may make a 'game maker'. That is, you will build a tool that someone with no C++ knowledge can use. Our pybind11 lab is a good starting point.


## Requirements (For either option)

### Documentation
Fire up 'Doxygen' <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">(Doxygen webpage)</a> to document the source code and automatically generate .html pages. Your documentation should cover your classes and functions.

Additionally, you documentation should have instructions on how to obtain, build, and run your final project.

### Build (binary file)
You need to have a compiled binary of your game. You can assume a target audience of either a 64-bit Mac, Ubuntu Linux, or Windows 10 machine. There should additionally be instructions about how to compile your code from source.

### Post mortem
A post mortem in games is a look back at what could be improved. Write a brief (2-3 paragraphs) on what could be improved if you had an additional 8 weeks to work on this project. Where would you allocate time, what tools would you build, would you use any different tools, etc.

### Website
Your documentation, a link to your binary, and your post mortem should be put together on a 1-page .html page. Additionally, provide a 1 minute video trailer(but 1 minute I suggest) and at least 3 screenshots of your game. This website will be the first place I look to grab your project. (Additionally, I think it is important to build a portfolio of your game development works!)

### Project Hieararchy

There should be some logical hierarchy for your project. Look to previous assignments for inspiration. Your project should not differ greatly unless there is a reason justified in your documentation.

## Rubric

This project will be evaluated in the following way. 

- 25% On meeting the requirements above
- 25% If you achieved your "Minimum viable product" (from your lab proposal.)
- 25% On the polish of your final project (did it work as intended, were there bugs, did I have to struggle to get your tool running)
- 25% On the creativity and overall 'wow' factor of your project. 
  - Some of this requirement *could* be met with the following idea. But you are not limited to this rubric.
    - Was there a cool feature or surprise that got me excited about the project?
    - Does this project have potential to be extended in the future?
    - Were there creative additional tools that supported your work.
    - Was there something not covered in class that you were excited about, learned, and implemented anyway? (Document this to bring to my attention if so!)
